I now have to have some text here to test if the excerpt stuff is gonna work. Not sure what to type so it is just going to be stupid stuff.

This should not go in the excerpt.

code test

```typescript
const foo: number = 2;
function bar(a: string, b: boolean): void {
  let test: string = `this is a template string ${foo}.`; 
}
```
