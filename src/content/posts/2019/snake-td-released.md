A few days ago I released my game Snake The Dots on the iOS app store.  
[Snake The Dots](games/snake-the-dots) is a small action game that plays like the classic snake game but has procedurally generated levels. The 
goal of the game is to complete as many floors as you can to get the highest score. To complete a floor you have to 
connect the dots on the floor with your snake. You eat food and coins to grow your snake.

It has been a journey since my previous game was released 5 years ago. It took me a while to find the right tools and the 
time to create another game. In the end it took me around 2.5 months to make this game in my spare time including making 
the game engine once I decided on the framework to use. I ended up using [Kha](http://kha.tech), a low level [haxe](https://haxe.org) 
framework as the base of my game engine.

I've spent the last few years changing between game engines every few months because I was missing a feature or didn't 
like how something works. I'm making small 2d games so I don't need an engine with a lot of features that I will never 
use and makes the game size larger for no reason so Unity and Unreal are out. I tried Defold and Godot but I'm not a fan 
of the languages they use. I like static typed languages. I tried Phaser with TypeScript but porting that to mobile has 
performance issues.
