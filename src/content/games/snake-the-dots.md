Snake The Dots is a mobile action game where you play as a snake and you get longer when you eat food just like in the
original snake game. You have to connect the dots in the level with your body to complete the level.  <!--more-->
Each level is procedurally generated. You move faster and have to complete a longer chain of dots as you complete more levels. When you hit the wall or yourself it is game over.

The game is still in development. I hope to release it before the end of 2019.
