Squishy's Escape is a small 2d platformer I created for Ludum Dare 35 in 48 hours. You can play it [here](http://codescapade.github.io/LD35/). Everything needs to be created during the Game Jam except for the game engine / framework. The theme of the jam was **Shapeshift**. In the game you can turn into a parachute and a heavy block to help you during the levels. There are only 6 levels because I ran out of time.

### Development
I used [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com) to build the game. I really like it because it is open source so if there is a bug or missing features you can add it yourself. It's small to install and no UI to learn. All you need is a text editor. Visual Studio Code has some good plugins for it.
