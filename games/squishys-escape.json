You can play it <a href=\"http://codescapade.github.io/LD35/\">here</a>. Everything needs to be created during the Game Jam except for the game engine / framework. The theme of the jam was <strong>Shapeshift</strong>. In the game you can turn into a parachute and a heavy block to help you during the levels. There are only 6 levels because I ran out of time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"games-static/squishys-escape/screenshot-1.png\" alt=\"SquishyScreenshot\"></p>\n<h3>Development</h3>\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://haxeflixel.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HaxeFlixel</a> to build the game. I really like it because it is open source so if there is a bug or missing features you can add it yourself. It's small to install and no UI to learn. All you need is a text editor. Visual Studio Code has some good plugins for it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"games-static/squishys-escape/screenshot-2.png\" alt=\"SquishyScreenshot2\"></p>\n","excerpt":"Squishy's Escape is a small 2d platformer I created for Ludum Dare 35 in 48 hours.
