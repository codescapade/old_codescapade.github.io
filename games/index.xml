      <description>Squishy&amp;rsquo;s Escape is a small 2d platformer I created for Ludum Dare 35 in 48 hours. You can play it here. Everything needs to be created during the Game Jam except for the game engine / framework. The theme of the jam was Shapeshift. In the game you can turn into a parachute and a heavy block to help you during the levels. There are only 6 levels because I ran out of time.</description>

      <description>I created Dr. Snake for Ludum Dare 41 in 48 hours. The theme was Combine 2 Incompatible Genres. I decided to combine snake, a topdown game with Dr. Mario, a game you look at from the side with gravity. The goal of the game is to remove all circles from the level by matching 3 or more snake body parts of the same color horizontally or vertically with the circle of that color.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Snake The Dots is a mobile action game where you play as a snake and you get longer when you eat food just like in the
original snake game. You have to connect the dots in the level with your body to complete the level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
