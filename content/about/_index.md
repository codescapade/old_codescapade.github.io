Hi I'm JuriÃ«n, a web / game developer. I've been working as a full stack developer for the past 2 years using mostly
[Angular](https://angular.io), [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) and [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/). I'm part of a Business Intelligence team creating internal tools for training and productivity.

In my spare time I create small games using all kinds of engines and frameworks from [Unity](https://unity.com) to [Haxeflixel](http://haxeflixel.com). I think I
tried them all at this point. At the moment I'm using [Cocos Creator](https://www.cocos.com/en/) to create a mobile
game.

I'm using this site as a portfolio for my games and projects and to blog about software development.
