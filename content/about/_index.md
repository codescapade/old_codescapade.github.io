Hi I'm JuriÃ«n, a web / game developer. I've been working as a full stack developer for the past 2 years using mostly
Angular Nodejs and Apps Script. I work in a Business Intelligence team creating new internal tools for training and productivity.

In my spare time I create small games using all kinds of engines and frameworks from Unity to Haxeflixel. I think I
tried them all at this point. At the moment I'm using [Cocos Creator](https://www.cocos.com/en/) to create a mobile
game.
