I decided to create a new portfolio / blog website two weeks ago. This is it, it is still a work in progress but it works.
I've made blog sites before but those were mostly Wordpress with an existing theme. This time I have a lot more experience in web dev so I wanted more control.

I used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to create it, instead of adding a theme I created one myself. I don't like a lot of bells and whistles so the design is pretty minimalistic. Since a lot of content is consumed on mobile these days I built the site for mobile first so it looks nice on any device. This was my first time creating a responsive website without using any frameworks so I could learn how it's done. It wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be, I think it turned out alright.

The plan for this blog is to share my experiences developing software and show things I learn along the way. Maybe somebody else can learn from it as well. I'm not sure how often I will post here yet, I have to figure that out. Thanks for reading.
