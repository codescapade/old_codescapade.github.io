{"title":"Switching to a new site generator","date":"2019-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","draft":false,"slug":"2019/switching-blog-framework","html":"<p>About two weeks ago I launched this blog. I wanted a simple blog generator that could generate static sites to host on Github Pages, <a href=\"https://gohugo.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hugo</a> seemed like the best choice. It is pretty easy to setup and use. Everything was working well until I added a dark mode.</p>\n<p>With Hugo you don't use a front-end framework, your static site is just a collection of separate pages. When I added the dark mode I added some JavaScript to check which mode you last used to add the appropriate css. With the dark mode enabled, when you go to a new page the background starts white and then has to add the dark mode css after. This makes the page flicker for a split second. That gets really annoying when you go from page to page.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h3>Finding a new generator</h3>\n<p>I needed a different generator, one that makes something like a single page app instead of separate pages. I looked at a few of them. <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gatsby</a> seems like a good one but I don't really like React a lot and it seems like you need a lot of plugins. <a href=\"https://gridsome.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gridsome</a> seems good as well it uses Vue instead of React. After trying it I couldn't get it to build properly. It might have been my fault or maybe because it is still pretty new. Both of these seemed a bit overkill for just a blog / portfolio.</p>\n<p>Then I found <a href=\"https://svelte.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Svelte</a>, it's a reactive framework like React and Vue but compiles your code into plain JavaScript so you end up with only the code needed to run your site. I never heard of it before but it looked promising. It's pretty easy to get started with it if you have used a reactive framework before. The framework that can generate static sites with Svelte is called <a href=\"https://sapper.svelte.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sapper</a>.</p>\n<p>Sapper is still in early development so there are some missing features and some bugs but overall it works quite well. I like that I have more control over the markdown parsing. I learned a lot about it over the weekend. With Sapper you convert your markdown page into HTML and then into JSON that you can query. It only took me a weekend to go from not knowing the framework to converting my whole blog to it. Feeling pretty good about that.</p>\n<p>So now this blog runs on Sapper. I will probably make a separate post about how to set it up because there isn't a lot of information on certain steps yet.</p>\n","excerpt":"About two weeks ago I launched this blog.
