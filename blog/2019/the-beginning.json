I don't like a lot of bells and whistles so the design is pretty minimalistic. Since a lot of content is consumed on mobile these days I built the site for mobile first so it looks nice on any device. This was my first time creating a responsive website without using any frameworks so I could learn how it's done. It wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be, I think it turned out alright.</p>\n<p>The plan for this blog is to share my experiences developing software and show things I learn along the way. Maybe somebody else can learn from it as well. I'm not sure how often I will post here yet, I have to figure that out.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading.</p>\n","excerpt":"I decided to create a new portfolio / blog website two weeks ago.
